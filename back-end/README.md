### Key design decisions

**Tools as plain functions, not a separate service** — `tools.js` defines the OpenAI tool schemas and their Prisma-backed implementations in one file, called directly from `openai.js`'s tool-calling loop. There's exactly one AI consumer in this app, so there's no need for a standalone tool server behind a wire protocol (we evaluated and deliberately moved away from an MCP-based split) — that indirection only pays for itself when multiple independent AI clients share one tool server.

**Atomic booking with double-booking prevention** — `$transaction([appointment.create, slot.update])` combined with a `@@unique([providerId, slotDate, slotStartTime])` DB constraint and P2002 error handling prevents race conditions.

**Full conversation history** — The complete OpenAI message chain (including tool_call and tool_result messages) is preserved and sent back on each turn, allowing GPT-4o to reference slot UUIDs from earlier in the conversation when the patient confirms a booking.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Fastify v5 |
| ORM | Prisma |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| AI Model | GPT-4o (OpenAI) |
| Tool calling | Plain in-process functions (`services/tools.js`) |
| Voice | Vapi.ai (outbound calls + server-side tool webhooks) |
| Email | Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP) |
| API Docs | Swagger UI at `/docs` |

## Database Schema

6 models: `Patient`, `Provider`, `ProviderSlot`, `Appointment`, `VisitHistory`, `Prescription`

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/chat/message` | Send message to Amara (AI assistant) |
| POST | `/api/voice/call` | Initiate Vapi outbound voice call |
| POST | `/api/voice/tool` | Vapi tool webhook (executes tools server-side) |
| POST | `/api/patients` | Register a new patient |
| GET | `/api/slots/available` | Query available appointment slots |
| POST | `/api/appointments` | Book an appointment |
| PATCH | `/api/appointments/:id/status` | Cancel an appointment |
| GET | `/api/visits` | Get visit history |
| GET | `/api/prescriptions` | Get prescriptions |

## AI Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `find_available_slots` | Query slots by specialty and date range |
| `book_appointment` | Atomic slot booking with double-booking prevention |
| `get_patient_appointments` | Fetch upcoming and past appointments |
| `get_patient_prescriptions` | Fetch prescriptions with refill status |
| `cancel_appointment` | Cancel and atomically release the slot |

## Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env   # fill in values

# 3. Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# 4. Seed sample data (1 week of slots, 4 providers, 3 patients)
node prisma/seed.js

# 5. Start server
node src/index.js
```

## Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user@localhost:5432/meddesk
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Email (Gmail SMTP)
SMTP_USER=yourname@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx    # Gmail App Password
SMTP_FROM="Amara <yourname@gmail.com>"

# Vapi voice calls
VAPI_API_KEY=...
VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=...
VAPI_SERVER_URL=https://your-public-url.com   # EC2 domain or ngrok URL for local dev
```

## What's Complete

- Patient intake and registration
- AI chat with GPT-4o and full tool calling (in-process, Prisma-backed)
- Slot availability search by specialty and date
- Appointment booking with double-booking prevention
- Appointment cancellation with slot release
- Prescription and visit history retrieval
- Outbound voice call handoff via Vapi with conversation context
- Voice assistant can execute all tools via webhook (book, cancel, check prescriptions)
- HTML confirmation email on booking via nodemailer
- Swagger API documentation

## What's Incomplete / Known Issues

- **Email**: Nodemailer is wired but `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` must be configured. Gmail App Password required.
- **Voice — phone number format**: Patient phone must be entered in US format during intake. International numbers not validated.
- **Voice — Vapi phone number**: Requires purchasing a phone number in the Vapi dashboard (~$2/month).
- **No authentication**: The app has no JWT/session auth. `patientId` is trusted from the client. Production would require Cognito or similar.
- **Prescription refill**: UI shows prescriptions but refill request flow is not implemented end-to-end.
- **SMS notifications**: Opt-in checkbox is wired in the UI but SMS sending (Twilio etc.) is not implemented.
- **Multi-timezone slot display**: Slots are displayed in UTC. Timezone-aware formatting not yet implemented.
